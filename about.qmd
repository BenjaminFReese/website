  <div class="section-header">Bio</div>
I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Government at Georgetown University, specializing in American Government and Quantitative Methodology, with interests in political economy, public administration, public opinion, and data science. 
  
  <div class="section-header">Current Positions</div>
  I am a Research Assistant in the Department of Government and a Quantitative Researcher at the Massive Data Institute in the McCourt School of Public Policy. Previously, I served as a Teaching Assistant in statistics, causal inference, and R and Stata programming.

  <div class="section-header">Research Focus</div>
My dissertation examines how labor unions have historically captured and continue to wield political power in the United States. My other research projects cover topics including civil service reform, political business cycles, ideology and elections, and enhancing transparency and accessibility of data related to federal bureaucrats and are currently under peer review at outlets such as the *American Journal of Political Science*, *Natureâ€™s Scientific Data*, *Research & Politics*, and *American Political Thought*.

  <div class="section-header">Professional Experience</div>
Before graduate school, I was the Chief of Staff for a Maryland state legislator, focusing on healthcare policy, government oversight, and auditing the state executive branch. My time as a Chief of Staff taught me about the complexities of legislating and political compromise. This experience drove me to pursue a PhD in American government and learn rigorous research methods to begin a career in government oversight and policy research.

  <div class="section-header">Personal Interests</div>
Outside of my professional pursuits, I enjoy watching and participating in combat sports and reading political biographies and American political philosophy.
